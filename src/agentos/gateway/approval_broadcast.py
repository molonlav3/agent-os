"""Push approval queue changes to Control connections over the WebSocket.

The approval queue is synchronous and may be written from a worker thread, so
its listener only hands each change to the event loop. The loop side coalesces:
a row resolved before its ``approval.requested`` went out (the auto-approve /
auto-deny policies resolve in the same call that queued it) is never announced
at all, so a policy decision does not flash a prompt in every open console.
